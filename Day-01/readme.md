### Key Takeaways:
- Blockchain is a **distributed ledger** system.
- It ensures **transparency, immutability, and decentralization**.
- Every block contains **data, hash, and previous hash**.
- **No single authority** controls the blockchain.

### Real-Life Analogy:
> Blockchain is like **Google Docs**:
> - Everyone has access (decentralized)
> - All edits are visible (transparent)
> - No one owns the original (shared control)
